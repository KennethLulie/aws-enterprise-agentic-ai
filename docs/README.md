# Documentation

This directory contains project documentation and guides.

## Structure

- `SECURITY.md` - Security guidelines and best practices
- `integration-test-checklist.md` - Integration testing procedures
- `completed-phases/` - Documentation for completed project phases
  - `PHASE_0_HOW_TO_GUIDE.md` - Complete Phase 0 implementation guide (Local Development Environment)

## Usage

Phase-specific documentation is moved to `completed-phases/` once that phase is finished to keep the root directory clean and focused on active development.
